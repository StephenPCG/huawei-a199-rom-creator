= Huawei A199 Customization =

This project is used to make customized huawei a199 rom.

=== Why not AndroidKitchen? ===

Huawei A199 locked boot.img and recovery.img, both images are signed off,
so we can not use third-party recovery, thus can not use sdcard to flash
new rom, we can only use so-called wire-flash. 
AndroidKitchen is used to create general sdcard-flash rom zips, and thus
not suitable for a199.

Although AndroidKitchen provided a lot of scripts and plugins to make
customized roms, writing plugins to create a199 rom based on AndroidKitchen
is not convenient.

So is this project for.
